// IteratorCtrl represents a narrow view of the iterator that exposes
// just the method, Valid which indicates when all items in the
// sequence have been consumed. The purpose of this is to allow a
// client abstraction, which implements the looping logic to provide
// a condition which halts its iteration. There are 2 scenarios:
// 1) the client wants to iterate the entire sequence; in this case
// the client just needs to continue the iteration until Valid
// returns false.
// 2) the client only wants to iterate the sequence until a certain
// other condition arises; in this case, the client combines the
// result of Valid() with another predicate within the for statement.

// Iterator represents an iterator over a slice. The underlying slice may
// be empty. When created, the iterator does not point to a valid
// slice entry. To begin iteration, the client invokes Start. At any stage
// after the iteration has started, the iterator, points to the current item
// in the sequence. The client can query the validity of the current item
// using the Valid method. To obtain successive elements, the client invokes
// the Next method and this can be continued until Valid returns false. Once
// Valid returns false, the client should no longer call Next. Doing so in
// this scenario, returns the zero value for the value T.
// It should also be noted that the iterator does not in itself implement
// the loop operation, it merely provides the logic to enable the client
// to implement the looping operation.
