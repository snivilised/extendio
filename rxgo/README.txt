This implementation is based upon the original version of rxgo at https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxGo, based upon generics rather than relying on reflection and interface{}. It is intended to replace this local version with the official version when and if it becomes available and for this to happen with minimal issues, the design here has to mirror the original as closely as possible.
